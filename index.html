<div class="grid-container">
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-1' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/1.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Besides the obvious P.O Final, Rob and I witnessing Scott Sinclair take on the entire Forest team from the halfway line and scoring - unbelievable</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-2' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/4.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> First double doube. Witnessing the 4 - 0 win in Cardiff means I've probably peaked away trips</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-3' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/5.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> One of my favourite all-time kits. Reminds me of Jermaine Easter in an mid-week evening game for some bizarre reason</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-4' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/6.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Another modern classic, and perhaps the best kit Joma produced for the Swans</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-5' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/7.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Screams Joel Asoro in my head. Not sure about the fit but a solid 3rd kit</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-6' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/8.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Either Swansea stealing a point at Stamford Bridge on the first weekend of the season, or Gomis being constantly offside</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-8' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/10.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Cyrus Christie, that wonderful man</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-9' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/11.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> A classic from the year 2000 - the not so glorious Bergoni days</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-10' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/13.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Bit of a rarity this one. Can't say I've seen many pictures or videos of the Swans in this kit, but a nice colour combo nonetheless</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/14.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> COVID Swans. Watching Con Robs sprinting up and down the wing, and another playoff bottling</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/15.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Trademark LDV Vans shirt this. LT10 and Andy Robs causing havoc - what a team</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/16.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Big Wilf Bony up tops and Europa League football - glorious times</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/18.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Modern remake of the 1984 Hummel kit. Would love to see them make a return as our supplier this summer</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/19.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> The only long-sleeve Swans shirt I own. 0 - 0 draws every week under Sousa sours any memory of this kit</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/20.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Original from 1993 which I'm far too scared to wear for fears I'll completely ruin it. Lovely</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/21.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Not sure if it's an original based on the Swans badge, but another 90's classic. Bring back the swirls</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/22.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Graham Potter champo ball, and that almost famous win over Man City in the FA Cup</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/24.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Chaotic season of 3 managers summed up with a blue kit - ych y fi</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/35.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Keeper kit so not much to say here. Reminds me of Andy Fisher and his sucicidal decision making</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/36.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Unreal green and black kit which deserves a remake. Peak lower league Swans smashing L1 under Roberto</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/37.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Another Swansea.com classic. Reminds me of Jordi Gomez's free kick against Cardiff in the cup</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/38.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Joel Piroe's last minute free kick against West Brom to win it - (probably) his last touch in a Swansea shirt. Still never got over the collar mind.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/39.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Similarly to the Red / Grey kit, don't quite remember seeing this shirt worn much in the mid-00's</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/40.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> My all-time favourite Swans kit. Centenary year. League Cup. Michu running riot. Glorious</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/41.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Similar to the Hummel remake, another gem from the 80's. The club would make a mint if they remade these for the club shop</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/42.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Rare one from New Balance who I forgot made our kits once upon a time. Very smart</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/43.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> What a classic. Screams James Thomas' hattrick and 8 year old me getting a lot more into football</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/44.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Despite the blue, think this is a very cool shirt from the 80s. Adidas Trefoil before it became cool</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/46.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> New Balance at it again. Love the bergundy Swans badge and the buttoned collar - big fan</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/47.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Could be the best 3rd kit yet - very sleek. Reminds me of Liam Cullen and his dastardly poaching</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/48.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Michu's debut and that 5 - 0 drubbing of QPR away. Finally broke the Loftus Road curse</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/49.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> YouTube clips of Alan Curtis' sidestep and goal against Leeds back in the olden days. Would love another sponsorless shirt someday</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/50.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Rhian Brewster and that mental Reading away game back in lockdown. Hideous kit</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/51.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Reminds me of bubblegum, Conor Hourihane, and absolutely nothing else</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/55.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Another obligatory Hummel remake. No fond memories because I wasn't born but what a sight</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/59.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> GWFX Adidas days were arguably the most boring for kits. Another season of generic templates</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/63.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Fernando Llorente scoring a thunderbastard against Man City, or Erfan and I travelling 6 hours to watch the Swans secure survival against Sunderland</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/64.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Not a bad effort trying to replicate the OG Gulf Oil kit, I like it</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/65.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Reminds me of a pinstripe suit more than anything. That or shithouse Gyokeres before he became good</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/68.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> LEGO LETOU SWANS!!!</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/70.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Not quite fondest but the 4 - 4 against Wolves. De Vries in goals for Wolves, Orlandi scoring within 60 seconds, and a big bottling after being 4 - 1 up. Vintage Swans</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/71.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> The first(?) Swans 3rd kit of recent times. Reminds me of Callum</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/72.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> The 2007 green and black kit if it was ordered off Wish.com. Enduring the snow to watch Ash chest in the winner against Arsenal at the Emirates - big big limbs</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/73.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Very fond of this kit (and the Swansea.com one's in general). Jason Scotland springs to mind</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/74.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Gylfi scoring a free kick - possibly on his debut - against Wigan away in the snow, and the start of the famous wall dive celebration which would embrace GOALS GOALS GOALS for years to come</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/75.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Watching the Super Swans knock out holders Portsmouth in the FA Cup, and seeing Nathan Dyer wind up the home fans</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/76.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> More Andy Fisher nightmares. A very hipster Swans kit - Jamie's wet dream</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/77.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Looks just like all the other Swansea.com home kits except this one shrunk in the wash. Still nice to look at though</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/79.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Ben Wilmott's header against Cardiff and a huge 1 - 0 win. Arguably the best home derby win to witness as it was tense for 60 minutes. The relief and joy at the full-time whistle was beautiful</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/80.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Weird Swansea Town addition. Not the greatest, nor is the YoBet sponsor which I'm convinced was a front for money laundering</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/81.jpeg' alt=''>

  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/82.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Another big addition (and another kit I'm too scared to wear). Tend to see the odd few of these in the crowds at Glasto each year</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/83.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Gorka Pintado in all red two-footing Robbie Savage at Pride Park</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/84.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Fondest Shirt Memory:</b> Watching Swansea hammer Valencia away 3 - 0 on ITV in complete disbelief. A mega team</p>
