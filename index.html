	<h2>My collection of Swansea City shirts (or at least most of them)</h2>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="grid-container">
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-1' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/1.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Besides the obvious P.O Final, fondest memory has got to be Rob and I witnessing Scott Sinclair take on the entire Forest team from the halfway line, scoring one of the best goals I've witnessed at the Swanscom yet - unbelievable</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-2' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/4.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> First double doube. Witnessing the 4 - 0 win in Cardiff means I've probably peaked away trips forever. Should probably get this one framed</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-3' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/5.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> One of my favourite kits - honestly panting for that black and dark grey gradient. Reminds me of Jermaine Easter during a mid-week evening game for some bizarre reason</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-4' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/6.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Another modern classic, and perhaps the best shirt Joma produced for the Swans...?</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-5' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/7.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Screams Joel Asoro and van der Hoorn in my head. Not sure about the fit but a solid 3rd kit even if the sponsor lets it down</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-6' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/8.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Either Swansea stealing a point at Stamford Bridge on the first weekend of the season, or Gomis being constantly offside rings round my head</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-8' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/10.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> A poor man's Murton Rovers shirt. Reminds me of Cyrus Christie and the half season where we had good fullbacks who could take on a man</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-9' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/11.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> A classic from the year 2000. The not so glorious Bergoni days</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-10' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/13.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Bit of a rarity this one. Can't say I've seen many pictures or videos of the Swans in this kit, but a nice colour combo nonetheless</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/14.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> COVID Swans. Watching Con Robs sprinting up and down the pitch, and another prime playoff bottling under Cooper</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/15.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Trademark LDV Vans shirt this. LT10 and Andy Robs causing havoc at the Millennium - what a football team</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/16.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Big Wilf Bony up tops and Europa League football. Watching us thrash Malmo and other minnow teams in the qualifiers beats a normal pre-season any day</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/18.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Modern remake of the 1984 Hummel kit. Would love to see Hummel make a return as our supplier this summer (update: this aged well)</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/19.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> The only long-sleeve Swans shirt I own. 0 - 0 draws every week under Sousa sours any happy memories of this kit. Need to get the big boy 32Red version soon</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/20.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Original from 1993 which I'm far too scared to wear for fears I'll completely ruin it. Lovely</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/21.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Not sure if it's an original based on the weirdly obscure Swans badge, but another 90's classic. Bring back the swirls I say</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/22.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Graham Potter champo ball, and that *almost* famous win over Man City in the FA Cup</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/24.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Chaotic season of 3 managers summed up with a blue kit - ych y fi</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/35.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Keeper kit so not much to say here. Reminds me of Andy Fisher and his suicidal decision making</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/36.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Unreal green and black kit which deserves a remake. Peak lower league Swans smashing League One under Roberto</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/37.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Another Swansea.com classic. Reminds me of that Jordi Gomez free kick against Cardiff in the cup</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/38.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Witnessing Joel Piroe's last minute free kick against West Brom to bag all 3 points - (probably) his last touch in a Swansea shirt. Still never got over the collar mind.</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/39.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Similarly to the Red / Grey Macron kit, don't quite remember seeing this shirt worn much in the mid-00's so can't quite place it</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/40.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> My all-time favourite Swans kit - so much so I own 5 of these as I feel they'll be worth a mint in future. Centenary year. League Cup. Michu running riot. Glorious</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/41.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Similar to the Hummel remake, another gem from the 80's. The club would make a mint if they remade these to sell in the club shop</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/42.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Rare one from New Balance who I forgot made our kits once upon a time. Very smart, wouldn't say no to a New Balance comeback</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/43.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> What a classic. Screams James Thomas' hattrick and 8 year old me getting a lot more into football to becoming the Jack Bastard I am now</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/44.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Very cool shirt from the 80s. Nice use of the Adidas Trefoil before it became outrageously trendy</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/46.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> New Balance at it again. Love the bergundy Swans badge and the buttoned collar - big fan</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/47.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Could be the best 3rd kit yet - very sleek. Reminds me of Liam Cullen and his dastardly poaching</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/48.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Michu's debut and that 5 - 0 drubbing of QPR away. Finally broke the Loftus Road curse</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/49.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> YouTube clips of Alan Curtis' sidestep and goal against Leeds back in the olden days. Would love another sponsorless shirt someday</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/50.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Rhian Brewster and that mental Reading away game back in lockdown. Hideous kit mind</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/51.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Reminds me of bubblegum, Conor Hourihane, and absolutely nothing else</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/55.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Another obligatory Hummel remake. No fond memories because I wasn't born but what a sight. Could see this Swans badge being used again soon for nostalgia</p>
  </div>
<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/59.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> GWFX Adidas days were arguably the most boring Swans for kits. Another season of generic templates with minimal effort</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/63.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Fernando Llorente scoring a thunderbastard against Man City, or Erfan and I travelling 6 hours to watch the Swans secure survival against Sunderland</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/64.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Not a bad effort trying to replicate the OG Gulf Oil kit from the 90's, I quite like it</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/65.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Reminds me of a pinstripe suit more than anything. That or shithouse Gyokeres before he became quite good</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/68.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> LEGO LETOU SWANS!!!</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/70.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Not quite my fondest memory but the 4 - 4 against Wolves. De Vries in goals for Wolves, Orlandi scoring within 60 seconds, and a big bottling after being 4 - 1 up. Vintage Swans</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/71.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> The first(?) Swans 3rd kit of recent times. Strictly reminds me of Callum and Callum only</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/72.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> The 2007 Macron green and black kit if it was ordered off Wish.com. Fondest memory enduring the snow to watch Ash chest in the winner against Arsenal at the Emirates - big big limbs</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/73.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Very fond of this gold trim kit (and the Swansea.com one's in general). The big man Jason Scotland springs to mind</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/74.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Watching a dodgy online stream witnessing Gylfi scoring a free kick - possibly on his debut - against Wigan away in the snow, and the start of the famous wall dive celebration which would embrace GOALS GOALS GOALS for years to come</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/75.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Witnessing the Super Swans knock out holders Portsmouth in the FA Cup on TV, and seeing Nathan Dyer wind up the home fans</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/76.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> More Andy Fisher nightmares. A very hipster Swans kit - Jamie's wet dream</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/77.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Looks just like all the other Swansea.com home kits except this one shrunk in the wash. Still nice to look at though</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/79.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Ben Wilmott's header against Cardiff and a huge 1 - 0 win. Arguably the best home derby win I've witnessed as it was on a knife edge for 65 minutes. The relief and joy at the full-time whistle was beautiful</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/80.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Weird Swansea Town addition. Not the greatest. Doesn't help having the YoBet sponsor which I'm convinced was a front for money laundering</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/81.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> A true beaut. Big Lee Trundle shoulder roll flashbacks down the Vetch</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/82.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Another big addition to the collection (and another kit I'm too scared to wear). Tend to see a few of these in the crowds at Glasto each year</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/83.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Gorka Pintado in all red two-footing Robbie Savage at Pride Park</p>
  </div>
	<div>
    <img class='grid-item grid-item-11' src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwgiuffrida/shirts/main/shirt/84.jpeg' alt=''>
    <p><b>Thoughts or Fondest Memory:</b> Watching Swansea hammer Valencia away 3 - 0 on ITV in complete disbelief. An underrated shirt imo. We were a mega team</p>
